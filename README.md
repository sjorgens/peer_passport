Instructions

In this activity, you will be provided a SQL file with user data. We will be playing the part of a banking institution, building out a full stack application allowing users to log in with their usernames and password. Once logged in, the user should be brough to their "Home" screen, which displays their balance, auto loan, and home loan.

Hard Mode

Style with Vanilla CSS or your favorite CSS library.

Pro Mode

Create a form to submit a payment to either loan, and have the updated values reflect on the screen.

That means send an amount to the server (say $45) and remove that from the loan, and return the new loan balance.
